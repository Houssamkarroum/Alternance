Candidate profile:
Commitment level: high
Engagement type: positive, constructive, consistent
Risk level: low
Compliance with rules: explicit and intentional
I am applying because the program is selective, temporary, and goal-constrained, which matches my availability and mindset. I accept and respect the stated rules: topic restriction (apprenticeship only), language constraints (Darija/French/English), and the expectation of non-negativity and active participation.
I am currently prioritizing an apprenticeship search and can allocate time and effort accordingly. I do not seek passive inclusion; I seek structured collaboration with measurable outcomes. I remain engaged until placement and understand the replacement mechanism once an apprenticeship is secured.
Conclusion: This profile matches the program’s intended participant model.","Primary objective: Apprenticeship (alternance)
Status: Actively searching
Engagement duration: Until placement
Outcome expectation: Successful placement + orderly exit from group",Yes,Yes,No,
